What is Conquest?

Conquest is an application that gamifies running. Unlike other running apps, Conquest emphasizes the competitive spirit of running and makes it fun. In Conquest, there are 3 teams - Knights, Ninjas, and Pirates. A player will select a team and conquer territory for their team or defend it. Players can not only progress physically while their app, but there is also a game progression as they use it.
